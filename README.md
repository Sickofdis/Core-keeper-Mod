# Core keeper internal

This internal has the following features:

[1] Unlimited Health

[2] Unlimited Food

[3] Unlimited Durability

## How to use

1 - Compile or Download the release

2 - Launch Core Keeper

3 - Inject the dll

I didn't make an injector for the dll but you can use Process Hacker to inject it.

You can enable and disable the mods by clicking the keys again. (By default they are disabled)

## To do

I will make an injector in the near future. 

Maybe i will add more options.
